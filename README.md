# **s**erve**d**ots

Serve Dots? ALPHA!

## Motivation

Helping to serve node.js server side in multiple forms?

Dots:

- OpenAPI schema generation
- Compability with multiple launch types (classic nodejs server, AWS Lambda)
- Typescript types for openapi client
- More dots?

## Usage

### Examples

...

Proper readme to be filled

# TODO (repo wide pieces):

- OpenApi could be a separate package, so that it does not get involved into actual servers?
- Add eslint and prettier
